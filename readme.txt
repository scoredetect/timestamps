3. Go through the Sign-in process. You can sign in with Gmail / Email and select a plan. We also offer a 7-day free trial guarantee.
4. Adjust your settings as needed. For example, you will want to set the "Display Created By" to Active. This will show your authorship in all certificates in the WordPress site.
5. Create a new post, or Edit an existing post. Make sure "Enable timestamps for this post" is Active. Wait 3-6 seconds. And you will see a popup appear. Your certificate has been created successfully!
6. To display your hyperlinked Timestamp for the post, you can either use the [timestamps] shortcode. Or, use the "Timestamps" block. Both will display your Timestamp.
7. The Timestamp will appear. Whenever you update this post, a new Timestamp will be generated. We associate the "previous timestamp" with the "new timestamp" to create a rich history of your content changing.
8. The version here associates this timestamp certificate with a previous timestamp certificate. All the information here is additional proof of your 1 timestamp. We store this in the blockchain so it is publicly available and secure. Only the "Hash" of the content is stored. Never the content itself, for security purposes.
9. The post we created earlier in the demo, gets referenced in the blockchain too. This makes it extremely difficult for someone else to claim the WordPress content as their own!
10. The blockchain information. Everything here is what is found in the Timestamp certificate.
