Timestamp your WordPress content to empower your content authenticity and increase user trust with our blockchain timestamping solution.

== Description ==
Timestamps allow you to increase content authenticity by displaying a rich timeline of your post updates. The timeline can be independently verified by the public, as a verification factor for your content.

Here is a list of features included in the plugin:

__Create a verification certificate__: You can enable timestamps for each post you work on. Upon every save, a __verification certificate__ is generated.

__Protect your content__: Your content gets a digital signature, so that you can __claim proof of your content__.

__Content authenticity__: Anyone can publicly view your verification certificate to __verify the claims 24/7__

__Rich Timeline__: You can re-save your content after modifying it, to gather a timeline of content modification. __Not just 1 certificate, but a chain certificate!__

__Secure Blockchain__: Your certificate is on the blockchain, making it __unchangeable__. This __significantly increases trust__ amongst your users.

__Custom Post Types Support__: The plugin supports all __publicly available custom post types__ such as Pages, and any other registered post type of your liking.

__Gutenberg / Block Editor Ready__: We aim for the latest technology. The plugin is ready for the __WordPress block editor__.

__Classic Editor Ready__: The plugin is also ready for the __Classic Editor__, so you can use it with the editor you prefer.

__Privacy Protection__: We strive for privacy, therefore __only administrators__ with the __manage_options__ capability can have access to perform actions with this plugin.

The plugin connects to the api.scoredetect.com service to create and update the verification certificates. The service is free to use with a 7-day free trial guarantee, and the plugin is free to use.
